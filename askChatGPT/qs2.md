## **How Each Field in an Incoming GraphQL Operation Gets Resolved**

In Apollo Server, **each field in a GraphQL query is resolved independently** by executing the corresponding **resolver function**. The resolution process follows a recursive depth-first traversal of the query.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution of a GraphQL Query**

### **Example Schema**

```graphql
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
}

type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  name: String
  age: Int
}
```

### **GraphQL Query**

```graphql
query {
  book(id: "1") {
    title
    author {
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

---

## **Execution Flow**

1. **Request Received**  
   - The Apollo Server receives the query request.  
   - The `context` function (if defined) runs and initializes shared data.

2. **Query Parsing and Validation**  
   - The query is parsed into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.  
   - Apollo validates the query against the schema.

3. **Resolver Execution (Depth-First Traversal)**  
   - Apollo starts execution from the **root field** (`Query.book`).  
   - It recursively resolves each field **depth-first**.

---

## **Field Resolution Breakdown**

| **Step** | **Field** | **Resolver Called** | **Returned Data** |
|----------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **1** | `book(id: "1")` | `Query.book(parent, args, context, info)` | `{ title: "GraphQL Guide", authorId: "10" }` |
| **2** | `title` | No resolver needed (scalar field) | `"GraphQL Guide"` |
| **3** | `author` | `Book.author(parent, args, context, info)` | `{ name: "John Doe", age: 45 }` |
| **4** | `name` | No resolver needed (scalar field) | `"John Doe"` |
| **5** | `age` | No resolver needed (scalar field) | `45` |

---

## **How Resolvers Work for Each Field**

### **Resolvers for the Above Schema**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    book: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // Fetch book by ID
      return { title: "GraphQL Guide", authorId: "10" };
    },
  },
  Book: {
    author: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // parent = { title: "GraphQL Guide", authorId: "10" }
      return authors.find(author => author.id === parent.authorId);
    },
  },
};
```

---

## **How Scalars Are Handled**

- If a field is a **scalar type** (`String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, etc.), Apollo directly returns the value without calling a resolver.
- In the above example, `title`, `name`, and `age` do **not** have explicit resolvers.

---

## **Resolver Execution Order**

Resolvers execute in **depth-first order**, meaning:

1. The **parent field is resolved first** (`Query.book`).
2. Then, each **child field is resolved** (`title`, `author`).
3. If a field requires additional fetching (`author`), it calls its resolver (`Book.author`).
4. The process continues **until all fields are resolved**.

---

## **Conclusion**

- Each field in a GraphQL operation is **resolved independently**.
- Execution follows a **depth-first traversal**.
- **Scalar fields** return data directly, while **object fields** invoke resolvers.
- The `parent` argument helps pass data down through resolvers.
