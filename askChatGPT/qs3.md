## **Handling Parent Resolvers and Field Resolution in Apollo Server**

### **What Happens If `Query.book` Already Returns an `author` Key and We Remove `Book.author` Resolver?**

If the `Query.book` resolver already returns an object containing the `author` field, then Apollo Server **does not need** to call the `Book.author` resolver. Instead, it will directly use the `author` field from the returned object.

---

## **Example Scenario**

### **Schema**

```graphql
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
}

type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  name: String
  age: Int
}
```

### **Updated Resolver (Without `Book.author`)**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    book: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      return {
        title: "GraphQL Guide",
        author: { name: "John Doe", age: 45 } // Already contains 'author'
      };
    }
  }
};
```

### **GraphQL Query**

```graphql
query {
  book(id: "1") {
    title
    author {
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

---

## **What Happens Internally?**

1. **Execution Starts at `Query.book` Resolver**  
   - The resolver **returns a `Book` object** containing both `title` and `author`.  
   - The `author` key **already contains the full `Author` object**.

2. **Apollo Resolves Fields Automatically**
   - `title` is a scalar → returned as is.
   - `author` is an object **already present** → **no need to call a separate `Book.author` resolver**.
   - `name` and `age` (inside `author`) are scalars → returned as is.

---

### **When is `Book.author` Needed?**
- If `Query.book` only returns an `authorId`, then a separate `Book.author` resolver is needed to **fetch the full author object**.
- Example:

  ```javascript
  Query: {
    book: (parent, args, context) => {
      return { title: "GraphQL Guide", authorId: "10" }; // Only returns ID
    }
  },
  Book: {
    author: (parent, args, context) => {
      return authors.find(author => author.id === parent.authorId); // Fetch author
    }
  }
  ```

---

## **What If `Query.book` Returns the `author` Object, But `Book.author` Resolver Still Exists?**  

If `Query.book` **already returns an `author` object**, but a separate `Book.author` resolver is still defined, **Apollo Server will call the resolver for `Book.author` anyway** unless the resolver is explicitly removed or avoided.  

---

### **Resolvers (Including `Book.author`)**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    book: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      return {
        title: "GraphQL Guide",
        author: { name: "John Doe", age: 45 } // Already returns full author
      };
    }
  },
  Book: {
    author: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      console.log("Book.author resolver called");
      return parent.author; // Redundant, as author is already provided
    }
  }
};
```

---

## **What Happens Internally?**

1. **Query Execution Starts at `Query.book`**
   - This resolver **already returns**:
     ```json
     {
       "title": "GraphQL Guide",
       "author": { "name": "John Doe", "age": 45 }
     }
     ```
   - The `author` object is already present.

2. **Apollo Still Calls `Book.author`**
   - Since a resolver is explicitly defined for `Book.author`, Apollo will execute it.
   - The resolver **logs "Book.author resolver called"** and returns the same `author` object again.
   - This is **redundant** and unnecessary.

---

## **Impact of Keeping `Book.author` Resolver**

| **Case** | **What Happens?** | **Best Practice** |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Without `Book.author`** | Apollo directly uses the `author` object from `Query.book`. | ✅ Best choice when `Query.book` already returns `author`. |
| **With `Book.author`** | Apollo **still calls** `Book.author`, even though the data is already present. | ❌ Unnecessary, avoid redundancy. |

---

## **How to Prevent Redundant Resolver Calls?**

1. **Remove the `Book.author` Resolver** (Best Practice)
   ```javascript
   const resolvers = {
     Query: {
       book: (parent, args, context) => ({
         title: "GraphQL Guide",
         author: { name: "John Doe", age: 45 } // Already providing full author
       })
     }
   };
   ```
   - Since the `author` object is **already returned**, Apollo won't need a separate resolver.

2. **Use a Conditional Check (If Keeping the Resolver)**
   ```javascript
   Book: {
     author: (parent) => {
       if (parent.author) {
         return parent.author; // Skip fetching if already present
       }
       // Otherwise, fetch from DB
       return fetchAuthorById(parent.authorId);
     }
   }
   ```
   - This prevents redundant execution **only when data is already available**.

## **Key Takeaways**

✔️ If `Query.book` **already returns the `author` object**, `Book.author` is **not needed**.  
✔️ If `Book.author` exists, **Apollo will call it anyway**, causing unnecessary execution.  
✔️ Removing the resolver or **checking if data already exists** prevents inefficiencies.
