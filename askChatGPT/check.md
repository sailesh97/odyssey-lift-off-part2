resolver function in apollo server and its 4 args. Explain usecases where and how the 4 args can be  useful
## Resolver Function in Apollo Server

In Apollo Server, resolvers are functions that handle GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions by fetching or modifying data from a database or other sources.

### Resolver Function Signature
A resolver function in Apollo Server receives the following four arguments:

```javascript
resolverFunction(parent, args, context, info) => { ... }
```

### Explanation of the Four Arguments

1. **parent** (or root)
   - Represents the return value of the previous resolver in the chain.
   - Useful in nested queries where a parent resolver passes data to its child resolvers.
   - Example Use Case:
     ```javascript
     const resolvers = {
       Query: {
         book: (parent, args, context) => {
           return { title: "GraphQL Guide", authorId: "1" };
         }
       },
       Book: {
         author: (parent, args, context) => {
           return authors.find(author => author.id === parent.authorId);
         }
       }
     };
     ```
     Here, `parent.authorId` helps fetch the correct author when resolving the `author` field inside `Book`.

2. **args**
   - Contains arguments passed in the GraphQL query or mutation.
   - Useful for filtering or identifying the requested data.
   - Example Use Case:
     ```javascript
     const resolvers = {
       Query: {
         user: (parent, args, context, info) => {
           return context.db.getUserById(args.id);
         }
       }
     };
     ```
     Here, `args.id` is used to retrieve a specific user by ID.

3. **context**
   - Holds shared data such as authentication info, database connections, request headers, or utility functions.
   - Useful for managing authentication, database access, and passing global data across all resolvers.
   - Typically set up in the Apollo Server configuration.
   - Example Use Case:
     ```javascript
     const resolvers = {
       Query: {
         currentUser: (parent, args, context, info) => {
           if (!context.user) {
             throw new Error("Unauthorized");
           }
           return context.user;
         }
       }
     };
     ```
     Here, `context.user` contains the authenticated user info, which is used to restrict access to the `currentUser` query.

   - **How context is set up in Apollo Server:**
     ```javascript
     const server = new ApolloServer({
       typeDefs,
       resolvers,
       context: ({ req }) => {
         const token = req.headers.authorization || "";
         const user = getUserFromToken(token);
         return { user };
       }
     });
     ```
     This ensures that every resolver can access `context.user` for authentication.

4. **info**
   - Contains metadata about the query execution, including:
     - The field name being resolved.
     - The execution path (useful for nested queries).
     - The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representation of the query.
   - Useful for logging, debugging, schema analysis, and optimizing database queries by fetching only requested fields.
   - Example Use Case:
     ```javascript
     const resolvers = {
       Query: {
         debugQuery: (parent, args, context, info) => {
           console.log("Field Name:", info.fieldName);
           console.log("Query Path:", info.path);
           console.log("Selections:", info.fieldNodes[0].selectionSet.selections.map(sel => sel.name.value));
           return "Debugging Info Logged";
         }
       }
     };
     ```
     Here, `info.fieldName` and `info.path` help debug the query execution, and `info.fieldNodes` allows extracting requested fields dynamically.

### Conclusion
Each of these arguments plays a crucial role in executing GraphQL queries effectively. By understanding how to use them properly, developers can build efficient, secure, and scalable APIs with Apollo Server.
